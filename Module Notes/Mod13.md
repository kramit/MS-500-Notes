Insider Risk Management from Microsoft 365

Insider Risk Management leverages the Microsoft Graph and other services to obtain real-time native signals across Office, Windows and Azure, including file activity, communications sentiment and abnormal user behaviors. Additional third-party signals from human resources (HR)   systems  can be included via an API-level integration  

A robust set of configurable playbooks tailored specifically for risks – such as digital IP theft, confidentiality breach, and potential security violations – use machine learning and intelligence to correlate the signals to identify hidden patterns and risks that traditional or manual methods might miss. Using intelligence and correlations allows the solution to focus on actual suspicious activities, so you don’t get overloaded with alerts. Furthermore, display names for risky users can be pseudonymized by default to maintain privacy and prevent bias. 
 
A comprehensive 360° view provides a curated and easy-to-understand visual summary of individual risks within your organization. This view includes an historical timeline of relevant in-scope activities and trends associated with each identified user. For example, you could see if a user submitted their resignation, downloaded some files and copied some of them to a USB device.. 

Finally, end-to-end integrated workflows ensure that the right people across security, HR, legal and compliance are involved to quickly investigate and take action once a risk has been identified. For example, if the risk was determined to be unintentional, I could send an email saying this is a violation of company policy with a link to training or the policy handbook. If the risk was determined to be malicious, I could open an investigation that would collate and preserve all the evidence collected, including the documents, and open a case for legal and HR to take appropriate actions.

Demonstration: Communication Compliance in Microsoft 365

Company communication channels continue to proliferate as organizations embrace collaboration and engage with their customers across multiple mediums.  While there are certainly significant benefits to increased collaboration and engagement, the volume of data that must be looked at for potential violations is increasing exponentially.  Not only do you have email, but also text messages, chat feeds, IMs, tweets, etc.  The current process that many organizations use to look for violations is often very process intensive, manual and involves multiple departments from IT, HR, Compliance, Legal etc.  In addition to this, the rise of regulatory enforcement, e.g. SEC17A –all contribute to an increased effort in reviewing potential violations by SMEs who are hard to find.  This often results in in violations slipping through the cracks which can have broad ramifications across compliance, credibility with customs, and company culture. 

Communication Compliance is a new solution that helps all organizations address code-of-conduct policy violations in company communications, while also helping organizations in regulated industries meet specific supervisory compliance requirements. Communication Compliance supports a number of company communications channels including Exchange email, Teams, Skype for Business Online, Twitter, Facebook and Bloomberg instant messages.

To provide granularity in identifying specific words and phrases, we have three out-of-box machine learning models to identify threats, harassment, and profanities. You can also build-your-own trainable classifiers that understand meaning and context that are unique to your organization’s need such as insider trading or unethical practice, freeing you from a sea of false positives.      

Once a violation has been flagged and the designated supervisor is alerted, it is important that the review process enables them to efficiently act on violations. Communication Compliance includes features such as historical user context on past violations, conversation threading and keyword highlighting, which together allow the supervisor to quickly triage the violation and take the appropriate remediation actions. 

The interactive dashboard provides an effective way to manage the growing volume of communications risks to ensure violations aren’t missed.  Proactive intelligent alerts on policy violations requiring immediate attention allows the supervisor to prioritize and focus on the most critical violations first.  In addition, violations, actions and trends by policy provide a quick view on the effectiveness of your program
