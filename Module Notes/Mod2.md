Azure AD pass-through authentication (PTA) helps ensure that password validation for services that rely on Azure AD, is always performed against an on-premises Active Directory
Azure AD pass-through authentication is configured by using Azure AD Connect, and it works by using an on-premises agent that listens for external password validation requests.
A server that runs the agent for pass-through authentication should be joined to the Active Directory domain where users are located.

Azure AD Connect Health helps you monitor and gain insight into your on-premises identity infrastructure and the synchronization services available through Azure AD Connect
This is accomplished by using an agent that is installed on the targeted servers.
