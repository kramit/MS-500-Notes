How it works
Cloud App Security is deployed with system admin privileges to allow full access to all objects in your environment. The App Connector flow is as follows:
Cloud App Security scans and saves Authentication permissions.
Cloud App Security requests the user list. The first time this is performed, it may take some time until the scan completes. After the user scan is over, Cloud App Security moves on to activities and files. As soon as the scan starts, some activities will be available in Cloud App Security.
After completion of the user request, Cloud App Security periodically scans users, groups, activities and files. All activities will be available after the first full scan.
