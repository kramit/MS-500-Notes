How ZAP works
Spam and malware signatures are updated in the service real-time on a daily basis. However, users can still receive malicious messages for a variety of reasons, including if content is weaponized after being delivered to users. ZAP addresses this issue by continually monitoring updates to the spam and malware signatures in the service. ZAP can find and remove messages that are already in a user's mailbox.

### Lesson 5: Microsoft Defender for Identity

This section describes how the flow of Microsoft Defender for Identity's network and event capturing works and drills down to describe the functionality of the main components: the Microsoft Defender for Identity portal, Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor, and Microsoft Defender for Identity cloud service. 
Installed directly on your domain controllers, the Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor accesses the required event logs directly from the domain controller. After the logs and network traffic are parsed by the sensor, Microsoft Defender for Identity sends only the parsed information to the Microsoft Defender for Identity cloud service (only a percentage of the logs are sent).
