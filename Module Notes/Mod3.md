### Lesson 2: Identity governance

Identity Governance helps organizations achieve a balance between productivity - How quickly can a person have access to the resources they need, such as when they join my organization? And security - How should their access change over time, such as due to changes to that person's employment status? Identity lifecycle management is the foundation for Identity Governance, and effective governance at scale requires modernizing the identity lifecycle management infrastructure for applications.

What is Conditional Access?

Security Benefits of Conditional Access

Conditional Access with Identity Protection is the best way to secure your identities and keep the bad guys out.
What it is: Conditional Access is an intelligent policy that allows you define conditions for how users authenticate and gain access to apps and data. 
How it works: Identity Protection with Conditional Access takes in over 171TB of identity-related security signals - like user behavior, location, state of device, application being accessed, and the risk score for user and sign-in. Using machine learning, we analyze the signals and determine the appropriate policy - allow, limit, block access or request additional verification.
For example, you might have a policy that requires MFA if the user is accessing from a new location. So when a user signs in from unfamiliar location they get an additional verification prompt before they are given access.
