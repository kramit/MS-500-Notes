You had control over your data when it resided within your boundaries
Now that boundary has expanded with managed devices and cloud assets. MDM solutions help but not when data moves outside of your controlled environment
Once shared outside your environment, you lose control over your data. 

On the productivity side – tool-tips for sensitivity labels are key. It helps with rollout during user education on how to manually apply labels.   A couple of things I’ve personally been patiently awaiting are the co-authoring/collaboration on sensitive documents and search of encrypted files in SPO. 

One the security side -  Think about levering built in tools in the Windows 10 to separate business from personal content and leveraging protected locations with the OneDrive sync client.   Also, DLP polices based on sensitivity labels have a lot of potential applications in terms of keeping your users productive and secure that I will talk about a bit more later.
